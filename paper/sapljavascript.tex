\begin{abstract}
This paper describes an implementation of a non-strict purely functional language in \JavaScript.
This particular implementation is based on the translation of a high-level functional language such as 
\Haskell or \Clean into \JavaScript via the intermediate functional language \Sapl. 
The resulting code relies on the use of an evaluator function to emulate the non-strict semantics of 
these languages.
The speed of execution is competitive with that of the \Sapl interpreter itself 
and other existing interpreters.
% like \textsf{Helium} and  \textsf{GHCi} and better than that of \textsf{Hugs}.
