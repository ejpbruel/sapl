\section{Benchmarks} \label{sapljs:sec:benchmarks}
In this section we present the results of several benchmark tests for the  \JavaScript implementation of \Sapl (which we will call \Sapljs) and a
comparison with the \Java Applet implementation of \Sapl. 
We ran the benchmarks on a MacBook 2.26 MHz Core 2 Duo machine running MacOS X10.6.4.
We used Google Chrome using the V8 \JavaScript engine to run the programs.
At this moment V8 offers by far the fastest platform for running \Sapljs programs.
However, there is a heavy competition on \JavaScript engines and they tend to become much faster.
The benchmark programs we used for the comparison are a subset of the benchmarks  we used for comparing 
\Sapl with other interpreters and compilers in \cite{JKP}. In that comparison it turned out that \Sapl is at least twice as fast (and often even faster)
as other interpreter like \textsf{Helium} , \textsf{Amanda}, \textsf{GHCi} and \textsf{Hugs}.
Here we used the \Java Applet version for the comparison. This version is about 40\% slower than the \C  version
of the interpreter described in \cite{JKP} (varying from 25 to 50\% between benchmarks), but is still faster than other interpreters like \textsf{Amanda}, \textsf{Helium} and \textsf{GHCi} and \textsf{HUGS}.
The \Java Applet and \JavaScript  version of  \Sapl  and all benchmark code can be found at \cite{SAPL}.
We briefly repeat the description of the benchmark programs here.

\begin{enumerate}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item {\bf Prime Sieve} The prime number sieve program, calculating the 2000th
prime number.
\item {\bf Symbolic Primes} Symbolic prime number sieve using Peano numbers,
calculating the 160th prime number.
\item {\bf Interpreter} A small \Sapl  interpreter. As an example we coded the prime
number sieve for this interpreter and calculated the 30th prime number.
\item {\bf Fibonacci} The (naive) Fibonacci function, calculating {\em fib 35}.
\item {\bf Match} Nested pattern matching (5 levels deep) repeated 160000 times.
\item {\bf Hamming} The generation of the list of Hamming numbers (a cyclic
definition) and taking the 1000th Hamming number, repeated 1000 times.
\item {\bf Sorting} Tree Sort (3000 elements), Insertion Sort (3000 elements), Quick Sort (3000 elements), Quick Sort (3000 elements) Merge
Sort (10000 elements, merge sort is much faster, we therefore use a much larger example)
\item {\bf Queens} Number of placements of 11 Queens on a 11 * 11 chess board.
\item {\bf Knights} Finding a Knights tour on a 5 * 5 chess board.
\item {\bf Prolog} A small Prolog interpreter based on unification only (no
arithmetic operations), calculating ancestors in a four generation family tree,
repeated 100 times.
\item {\bf Parser Combinators} A parser for Prolog programs based on Parser
Combinators parsing a 3500 lines Prolog program.
\end{enumerate}

For sorting a list of size $n$ we used a source list consisting of numbers $1$
to $n$. The elements that are 0 modulo 10 are put before those that are 1 modulo
$10$, etc.

The benchmarks cover a wide range of aspects of functional programming (lists, laziness, 
deep recursion, higher order functions, cyclic definitions, pattern matching, 
heavy calculations, heavy memory usage).
All times are machine measured. The programs where chosen in such a way that
they ran for at least a second or longer, if possible. This to eliminate start-up 
effects and to give the JIT compiler enough time to do its work. 
The output was always converted to a single number (e.g. 
by summing the elements of a list) to eliminate the influence of slow output 
routines.

\subsection{Benchmark Tests}
We ran several tests for several version of \Sapljs to evaluate the effectiveness of several
optimizations. 
We distinguish the following versions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\Sapl} The \Java Applet version of \Sapl.
\item{\Sapljs plain} The  version using the simple compilation scheme and not using the conversion of arithmetical expressions 
to their \JS counterparts, but instead using built-in functions the handle them. 
\item{\Sapljs arith} The version using the simple compilation scheme with the conversion of arithmetical expressions.
\item{\Sapljs opt} The version using the static detection of evals of closures.
\item{\Sapljs strict} The previous version, including and using programmer made strictness annotations.
\end{itemize}

As an example to illustrate the effect of the different compilation schemes, consider the following \Sapl program and its translations.

- sapl program

- plain compilation

- plain with arith

- optimized

- with strictness annotations

\subsection{Evaluation of the Benchmark tests}
Before analysing the result we first make some general remarks about the performance of \Java, \JS and the \Sapl interpreter which are relevant for
a better understanding of the results. In general it is difficult to give absolute figures when comparing the speed of language implementations. 
They often depend on the platform (processor), the used operating system running on it and the benchmarks used to compare. 
Therefore, all numbers given represent rather rough estimations and should be used as global indications. 
For example, the language shoot-out site (add reference) indicates that \Java 
programs run between 3 and 5 times faster than \JS programs running on V8. 
Our own measurements on the used platform indicate that in our case the factor is about 3.

For a lazy functional language the creation of closures and the re-collection of them later on, often take a substantial part of program run-times.
It is therefore important to do some special tests that say something the speed of memory (de-)allocation.
The \Sapl interpreter uses a dedicated memory management unit (see \cite{JKP}) not depending on \Java memory management. 
The better performance of the \Sapl interpreter in comparison with the other interpreters partly depends on its fast memory management.
For the \JS implementation we rely on  the memory management of \JS itself.
We did some dedicated tests that showed that memory allocation for the \Java\ \Sapl interpreter is about 4-6 times as fast as for the \JS implementation.

Say something about percentage of time spend on memory management for benchmarks.

We could not run all benchmarks as long as we wished because of stack limitation for V8 \JS in Google Chrome. 
It support a standard stack of only 30k at this moment.
This is certainly enough for most \JS programs, but not for a number of our benchmarks that can be deeply recursive. 
Also forced \textsf{eval} calls can become deeply recursive. 
This limited the size of the runs of the following benchmarks: interpreter and all sorting benchmarks. 
Another benchmark we used previously: \textsf{twice twice twice twice inc 0}, could not be run at all.

For many \Sapljs examples a substantial part of their run-time is spent on memory management. 
They can only run significantly faster after a more efficient memory management is realized.
It is tempting to implement a memory management similar to that of \Sapl. 
But this memory management relies heavily on representing graphs by binary trees, 
which does not fit with our model for turning closures into \JS function calls which depends heavily on using arrays to
represent graphs.

We may conclude that memory management take a considerably percentage of execution time for the \Sapljs programs than for
the \Sapl interpreter. This explains why a number of the benchmarks execute slower than for the \Sapl interpreter, despite the fact
that the resulting code can be compiled instead of being interpreted as in \Sapl.

For example, \textsf{fibonacci} natively implemented in \Java runs 3 times as fast than programmed natively for \JS.
Adding strictness annotations in the \Sapl code of \textsf{fibonacci} takes care that the \JS translation result in the same code 
as the native one. 

\subsection{Alternative Optimizations}
In \JS it is possible to explicitly make curried versions of functions of mare than 1 argument.
